MariaDB's data-at-rest encryption requires the use of a key management and encryption plugin. 
These plugins are responsible both for the management of encryption keys and for the actual encryption and decryption of data. 

However this plugin come with some limitations.

You are bound to trust your operators when it comes to encryption, and often in regulated environment
where separation of privileges is paramount that's not always possible.

This is where the awemaria plugin helps, once setup you can setup different shards to unlock your database without giving away the master encryption key.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
